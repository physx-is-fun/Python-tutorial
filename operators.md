# Operators

Python operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands. These are symbols used for the purpose of logical, arithmetic and various other operations. Consider the expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator. In this tutorial, we will study different types of Python operators.

## Types of Python Operators

Python language supports the following types of operators:

    Arithmetic Operators
    Comparison (Relational) Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Membership Operators
    Identity Operators

## Python Arithmetic Operators

Python arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. These operations are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Expoents and Floor Division.

    + (Addition)
    - (Subtraction)
    * (Multiplication)
    / (Division)
    % (Modulus)
    ** (Exponent)
    // (Floor division)

## Python Comparison Operators

Python comparison operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called relational operators. These operators are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to and less than or equal to.

    == (Equal)
    != (Not equal)
    > (Greater than)
    < (Less than)
    >= (Greater than or equal to)
    <= (Less than or equal to)
