# Operators

Python operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands. These are symbols used for the purpose of logical, arithmetic and various other operations. Consider the expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator. In this tutorial, we will study different types of Python operators.

## Types of Python Operators

Python language supports the following types of operators:

    Arithmetic Operators
    Comparison (Relational) Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Membership Operators
    Identity Operators

## Python Arithmetic Operators

Python arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. These operations are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Expoents and Floor Division.

    + (Addition)
    - (Subtraction)
    * (Multiplication)
    / (Division)
    % (Modulus)
    ** (Exponent)
    // (Floor division)
