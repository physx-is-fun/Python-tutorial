# Operators

Python operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands. These are symbols used for the purpose of logical, arithmetic and various other operations. Consider the expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator. In this tutorial, we will study different types of Python operators.

## Types of Python Operators

Python language supports the following types of operators:

    Arithmetic Operators
    Comparison (Relational) Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Membership Operators
    Identity Operators

## Python Arithmetic Operators

Python arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. These operations are Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Expoents and Floor Division.

    + (Addition)
    - (Subtraction)
    * (Multiplication)
    / (Division)
    % (Modulus)
    ** (Exponent)
    // (Floor division)

## Python Comparison Operators

Python comparison operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called relational operators. These operators are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to and less than or equal to.

    == (Equal)
    != (Not equal)
    > (Greater than)
    < (Less than)
    >= (Greater than or equal to)
    <= (Less than or equal to)

## Python Assignment Operators

Python assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. These operators include simple assignment operator, addition assign, subtraction assign, multiplication assign, division and assign operators etc.

    = (Assigment operator)
    += (Addition assigment)
    -= (Substraction assigment)
    *= (Multiplication assigment)
    /= (Division assigment)
    %= (Remainder assigment)
    **= (Exponent assigment)
    //= (Floor division assigment)

Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit by bit operation. Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; Now in the binary format their values will be 0011 1100 and 0000 1101 respectively. Following table lists out the bitwise operators supported by Python language with an example each in those, we use the above two variables (a and b) as operands âˆ’

a = 0011 1100
b = 0000 1101

--------------------------

a&b = 12 (0000 1100)
a|b = 61 (0011 1101)
a^b = 49 (0011 0001)
~a  = -61 (1100 0011)
a << 2 = 240 (1111 0000)
a>>2 = 15 (0000 1111)

There are following Bitwise operators supported by Python language:

    & (Binary and - Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1)
    | (Binary or - Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1)
    ^ (Binary xor - Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1)
    ~ (Binary ones complement - Inverts all the bits)
    << (Binary left shift - Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off)
    >> (Binary right shift - Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off)
